== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is EzDeFi? How does it work? How can I pay or receive cryptocurrency payment? =

EzDeFi is a payment gateway that helps merchants worldwide accept cryptocurrency payments in a fully decentralized way.

How this works

* When you want to pay a merchant, we will display instructions on how to send funds directly to this merchant through a QR code.
* After a valid payment is confirmed, we will notify the merchant so they can take any necessary actions on their end.

All payments facilitated by ezDeFi are fully decentralized and peer-to-peer. This means that the cryptocurrency goes directly from your wallet to a wallet that is only accessible by the merchant. At no point in this flow does anyone except the merchant, including ezDeFi, have access to these funds.

= How do I get a refund? Can ezDeFi help me with this? =

Because ezDeFi doesn’t keep merchant’s private key, if you would like a refund, please contact the merchant directly.

All transactions made with cryptocurrency are direct peer-to-peer payments from the customer to the merchant. This means that once a payment is sent, there is no way for ezDeFi to reverse the transaction or reclaim funds on your behalf. As a result we are unable to resolve any payment disputes as the transactions are secured by the blockchain and are irreversible.

= I haven’t received the item I purchased. What can I do? =

Please reach out to the merchant directly regarding any issues with your order or an update on your order status.

If you believe that this merchant may be running a scam, please send an email to [cs@ezdefi.com](cs@ezdefi.com) with all relevant details and a member of our security and investigations team will take a look into the merchant’s account.

= How can I convert cryptocurrency to fiat currency e.g. USD, EUR, JPY, etc? =

Currently, ezDeFi doesn’t offer the settlement for fiat currency mentioned above.

Merchants could access to popular or local OTC exchange exchange between their cryptocurrency / fiat currency pair.

= How can I track my payment? =

For each cryptocurrency, there are many different explorer websites that offer the service to track cryptocurrency payment.

E.g:

Track BTC payment through [btc.com](btc.com)

Track ETH payment through [etherscan.io](etherscan.io)
